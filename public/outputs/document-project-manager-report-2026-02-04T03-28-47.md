I can create a report and send it to your Workspace, but I don't have access to your Google Sheets data. I can only see the support cases currently loaded from Dataverse - you have 4 active cases including a login issue, billing discrepancy, password reset problem, and a feature request. If you want me to generate a report based on those cases, I can do that. Otherwise, you'd need to share the Google Sheets data with me first.
