I appreciate the question, but I need to be upfront with you: **I don't actually have access to any task table, meeting records, or what's on your screen right now.**

Here's what I can actually do:

✅ **I CAN:**
- Answer questions about information YOU tell me
- Help you organize and summarize data you share
- Create documents and reports
- Provide PM guidance and advice

❌ **I CANNOT:**
- See your screen or any applications you're using
- Access external databases, task management tools, or meeting records
- Pull real-time data from your systems
- Remember previous conversations (each chat starts fresh for me)

**What you're describing sounds like what a true integrated PM assistant would do** — connecting directly to your project tools to pull live task data, meeting info, etc. That would be really useful! But that's not my current capability.

**If you want to tell me about your last task, I'm happy to help you:**
- Summarize it
- Update it with new info
- Create follow-up action items
- Draft communications about it

Just share the details and I'll work with what you give me! 👍
