I can see your screen is displaying a split view of two applications:

**On the left side**, you have the **Project Manager 7 - Claude** web interface open, showing test documentation. I can see instructions for testing Claude AI's vision and screen-sharing capabilities. Specifically, there's Step 5 which asks users to say "Hey Claude, what do you see on my screen?" and describes the expected results (server logs should show "CLAUDE WAKE WORD DETECTED" and responses should appear via TTS and in the Bot Response panel). Below that is Step 6 about Dataverse integration testing.

**On the right side**, there's the **PM AI Bot - Meeting Observer** application, which appears to be a meeting monitoring tool. It has connection settings with a server URL field and a "Connect" button, plus a screen capture section. There's an active notification at the bottom indicating that "localhost:3000 is sharing your screen and audio" with a "Stop sharing" button available.

This looks like you're actively testing the integration between Claude AI and the meeting observer bot, specifically testing the screen-sharing and vision analysis features outlined in the documentation on the left.
